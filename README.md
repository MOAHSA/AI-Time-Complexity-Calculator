# AI Code Complexity & Optimization Tool

An intelligent, AI-powered code editor designed to analyze code complexity, provide performance optimizations, and facilitate a deep understanding of algorithms. This tool leverages Google's Gemini AI to offer real-time insights for Python, Java, and C++ code.

## Key Features

- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Analysis:** Instantly determine the Big O time complexity of your code. Click on any line number to get a detailed breakdown of its execution count and contribution to the overall complexity.
- **üí° Smart Optimization:** Receive intelligent, actionable suggestions to improve your code's performance and efficiency, complete with detailed explanations and code examples.
- **üí¨ Interactive AI Chat:** Discuss the optimization results directly with the AI. Ask follow-up questions, clarify concepts, and explore alternative solutions within the context of your code.
- **üìö Curated Learning Resources:** Each optimization comes with AI-sourced links to high-quality articles, videos, and documentation to help you learn the underlying computer science principles.
- **üåê Multi-Language Support:** Analyze code in Python, Java, and C++, with automatic language detection to streamline your workflow.
- **üé® Customizable Experience:** Tailor the editor to your liking with multiple themes (Modern, Neon, Light, Ocean), adjustable font sizes, and various professional monospaced fonts.
- **üìñ Optimization History:** All your optimization sessions, including the full chat conversations, are automatically saved. Revisit past results and discussions at any time from the history sidebar.

## User Guide (How to Use)

1.  **Write Code:** Write or paste your code into the editor. You can select a specific language in the settings, or leave it on "Auto" for automatic detection.
2.  **Analyze Complexity:** Click the **Analyze** button in the status bar. The overall Big O notation will appear at the bottom.
3.  **View Line Details:** After the analysis is complete, **click on any line number** in the gutter to see a tooltip with its specific execution count and analysis.
4.  **Get Optimizations:** Click the **Optimize** button. A modal will appear with the AI's suggestions, learning resources, and a chat window.
5.  **Discuss with AI:** Use the chat input in the optimization modal to ask follow-up questions about the suggested changes or related concepts.
6.  **Review History:** Click the **History** (clock) icon in the status bar to open the sidebar and browse your past optimization sessions.
7.  **Customize Settings:** Click the **Settings** (gear) icon to change the application theme, editor font, font size, and line height.

## Local Development & Installation

This project runs directly in the browser without a build step. Follow these instructions to run it on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
-   A Google Gemini API key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
-   A local web server. If you have Python installed, you can use its built-in server.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Get the Code:** Clone the repository or download the source files to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MOAHSA/AI-Time-Complexity-Calculator
    cd AI-Time-Complexity-Calculator
    ```

2.  **Configure Your API Key:**
    For local development, you must insert your API key directly into the code.
    -   Open the file `services/geminiService.ts` in a text editor.
    -   Find the following line (near the top of the file):
        ```typescript
        const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });
        ```
    -   Replace `process.env.API_KEY` with your actual Gemini API key, wrapped in quotes. It should look like this:
        ```typescript
        const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" });
        ```
    -   **IMPORTANT:** Do not commit this change or share this file publicly with your API key inside it. This modification is for local testing only.

3.  **Serve the Files:**
    -   Open your terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory.
    -   Start a simple local web server. If you have Python 3, run:
        ```bash
        python3 -m http.server
        ```
        If you have an older version of Python, you might need to use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.

4.  **Open in Browser:**
    -   Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by your local server. It is typically `http://localhost:8000`.
    -   The application should now be running and fully functional.

## Building the Application

This project is designed to run directly in the browser without a traditional build step. There is **no need** to run commands like `npm run build` or use tools like Webpack or Vite.

This is made possible by using modern browser features like **ES Modules** and an **`importmap`** in `index.html`. All dependencies (like React, CodeMirror, etc.) are loaded directly from a Content Delivery Network (CDN), and the browser handles the TypeScript compilation on the fly.

### Deployment

To deploy this application, you simply need to host the project's static files. You can upload the entire project directory (containing `index.html`, `index.tsx`, `components/`, etc.) to any static hosting provider.

Popular free options include:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- Cloudflare Pages

The hosting service will serve the `index.html` file, and the browser will handle the rest, just like your local web server does.

The project is organized into a clear and maintainable structure.
