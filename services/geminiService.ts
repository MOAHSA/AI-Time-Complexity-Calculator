### CONTEXT
The user is asking a follow-up question about a code optimization suggestion.
- Original ${language} code:
\`\`\`${language}
${originalCode}
\`\`\`
- Your initial optimization suggestion:
---
${optimizationSuggestion}
---
- Conversation History:
${history.map(msg => `${msg.role === 'user' ? 'User' : 'AI'}: ${msg.content}`).join('\n')}

### USER'S NEW QUESTION
${newUserMessage}

### YOUR TASK
Answer the user's new question based on the full context provided, adhering strictly to the following professional standards and formatting requirements.

### RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS

#### 1. Formatting and Clarity
- **Structure:** Start with a "### Short Answer" section that provides a concise, direct summary. Follow this with a "### Deep Answer" section for the full, detailed explanation including examples, tables, and diagrams.
- **Sections:** Within the "Deep Answer", organize your content into clear sub-sections using Markdown headings (e.g., \`## Binetâ€™s Formula\`, \`## Python Implementation\`).
- **Readability:** Break long paragraphs into shorter, more digestible ones.
- **Code Blocks:** Enclose all code snippets in fenced code blocks (\`\`\`) and specify the programming language.
- **Mathematical Notation:** Use LaTeX syntax for mathematical expressions, enclosed in dollar signs (e.g., \`$O(n \\log n)\` for inline, \`$$F_n = ...$$\` for block).
- **Tables:** If comparing concepts, provide data in a well-formatted Markdown table with a clear header row.
- **Diagrams:** When helpful, include flowcharts or diagrams using Mermaid syntax inside a \`\`\`mermaid fenced code block.

#### 2. Content and Precision
- **Define Terms:** Explicitly define key terms (e.g., "$F_n$ is the n-th Fibonacci number," "$\\phi$ is the golden ratio").
- **Code Comments:** Add concise, meaningful comments inside code blocks to explain key steps.
- **Numerical Stability:** Precisely address limitations, such as floating-point precision errors (e.g., "IEEE 754 double precision gives exact integer results for Fibonacci numbers up to F(71)").
- **Alternatives:** When discussing limitations, suggest robust alternatives (e.g., "for higher precision, use Python's \`decimal\` library").

#### 3. Structure and Tone
- **Conclusion:** End the "Deep Answer" with a strong summary. Use bullet points for pros and cons to provide clear takeaways.
- **Style:** Maintain a professional, educational tone. Use active voice where possible.
- **Follow-up:** After the main content, provide a "### Suggested Questions" section with 2-3 relevant follow-up questions the user might have.

Please produce a response following this structure so my application can automatically parse and display it effectively.`;
